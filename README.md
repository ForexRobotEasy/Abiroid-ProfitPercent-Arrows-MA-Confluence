# Forex Robot Easy - Abiroid ProfitPercent Arrows MA Confluence

This is a trading robot code developed by the Forex Robot Easy team, specifically for the Abiroid ProfitPercent Arrows MA Confluence strategy. The code is written in MQL4 language and is compatible with the MetaTrader 4 platform.

## Product Description

Forex Robot Easy presents the Abiroid ProfitPercent Arrows MA Confluence, a powerful and versatile trading robot designed to generate consistent profits in the forex market. This robot is based on a combination of moving averages (MA), on-balance volume (OBV), Heiken Ashi, average directional index (ADX), SuperTrend, and parabolic SAR (PSAR) indicators.

With its advanced algorithm, the Abiroid ProfitPercent Arrows MA Confluence robot identifies high-probability trading signals and executes trades automatically based on the user-defined input parameters. It provides both buy and sell signals, allowing traders to capitalize on market movements in any direction.

## Key Features:

1. Moving Averages (MA): The robot utilizes the MA indicator to identify trend reversals and potential entry points.

2. On-Balance Volume (OBV): The OBV indicator is used to confirm the strength of the prevailing trend and validate trading signals.

3. Heiken Ashi: The Heiken Ashi indicator smooths price fluctuations and helps identify trend direction more accurately.

4. Average Directional Index (ADX): The ADX indicator is used to gauge the strength of the current trend and filter out weak signals.

5. SuperTrend: The SuperTrend indicator helps identify potential trend reversals and generates reliable entry and exit signals.

6. Parabolic SAR (PSAR): The PSAR indicator is used to determine potential stop-loss levels and exit points in a trade.

7. Higher Time Frame EMA: The robot incorporates a higher time frame exponential moving average (EMA) to validate the overall trend direction.

## Input Parameters:

- MA period: The period used for calculating the moving averages.
- OBV distance: The minimum distance between OBV values for validation.
- ADX period: The period used for calculating the average directional index.
- SuperTrend multiplier: The multiplier value for calculating the SuperTrend.
- PSAR step: The step value used in calculating the parabolic SAR.
- PSAR maximum: The maximum value used in calculating the parabolic SAR.
- EMA period: The period used for calculating the higher time frame EMA.

## How It Works:

1. Custom indicator initialization function (OnInit): Initializes all the necessary indicators and assigns them to their respective handles.
2. Custom indicator deinitialization function (OnDeinit): Releases all the indicator handles to free up system resources.
3. Custom indicator iteration function (OnCalculate): Called for each new price tick to calculate trading signals and execute trades.
   - Calculates the main signal indicators (MA cross, OBV cross, Heiken Ashi cross) based on previous and current values.
   - Validates the signal indicators (OBV, Heiken Ashi, ADX, SuperTrend, PSAR, EMA) based on predefined conditions.
   - Generates buy or sell signals based on the combination of signal and validation indicators.
   - Executes the corresponding trade logic for buy or sell signals.
